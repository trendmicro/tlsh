Review on women and girls Education and Gender equal in Basic Education in Sri Lanka

Introduction

Sri Lanka

Sri Lanka is an island in the Indian Ocean situated to the south of the Indian subcontinent with a land area of 65,000sq. Kilometres, laying a few degrees north of the equator.

Sri Lanka gained independence from the British who ruled the country for 150 years, in 1948. After independence a democratically elected Westminster model type of Government governed the country. In 1972 it became a Republic and in 1978 an Executive Presidency model was adopted. At the centre, there is the legislature, the Parliament and the Executive President, but the power of government is substantially devolved to the elected Provincial Councils. There are eight Provincial Councils functioning under the existing set up. The grass root level local government system assures people's participation in managing their local affairs.

People and Society.

The population of Sri Lanka in the year 2000 is estimated to be 18.5 million and is increasing moderately at 1.2 percent per annum. The country has almost reached the stage of demographic transition, and it is estimated that by the year 2020 the population will stabilize at 22 million. The decline in the rate of population growth has led to a reduction in the young dependency ratio, which is a favourable development for the education sector as the decreasing numbers will enable the authorities to divert more resources for quality improvement. However, with the increase in life expectancy of the population, the elderly dependent ratio will increase iii the future.

The population of Sri Lanka consist of a mix of many ethnic groups whose ancestors migrated and settled down in this country over the centuries. As a result the present population is a mosaic of different ethnic groups and religious denominations, within multi-cultural milieu. Ethnically, the Singhalese comprise 74% of the population, the Sri Lankan Tamils 1.2.6%, the Tamils of recent Indian origin 5.3%, the Muslims 7.1% and others 1%. Religion-wise, there are 69% Buddhists, 15% Hindus, 7% Muslims and 8% Christians of various denominations. Each cultural entity maintains its own customs and practices with a, distinct identity, but all contribute of form a Sri Lankaan identity as citizens of one country.

The per capita income in the year 2000 was U'S$ 864. However, the quality of life as shown by the Human Development Index (HID) compiled by the United Nations shows that Sri Lanka enjoys a high quality of life in comparison to countries having a similar or a higher level of per capita income. Some of the components taken into account in the compilation of the HDI, such as literacy at 91%, life expectancy of 72 years and infant mortality at 16,9 per thousand are impressive achievements in social development. These are the results of the social welfare measures persuade by successive governments after independence, to which free education has made a remarkable contribution.

On gender issues the country has followed an enlightened policy. The right to vote irrespective of any restrictions granted with universal Suffrage in 1931 and the provision of educational facilities for women without discrimination have established gender equity in Sri Lankan society. Women outnumber men in enrolment in secondary education and in professions such as teaching. Participation of women in other professions in increasing.

People of Sri Lanka have been enjoying free Education over the last 50 years. As a result of this we have a high literacy rate in the region. In comparison to the other developing countries Sri Lanka has a high quality of life. Some of the factors contribute to compile the. HD 1 (The human development index) such as life expectancy of 72, Infant mortality at 1.6.9 is impressive achievements in social development. The free education has made a remark-able contribution to social developments.

Demand for Education has grown up rapidly 'as education played a vital role in social mobility in Sri Lanka since independence, with the introduction of free education up to tertiary level, changing over to mother tongue as the medium of instruction and establishment of a wide network of schools (90% of which are mixed schools) The free education is further strengthened by giving free textbooks and uniform materials to every student in schools leading to less disparities. These changes have provided equal opportunities for every citizen of Sri Lanka to enter the formal education system. The gender disparities in education too have been reduced simultaneously.

1. Basic education in Sri Lanka

The total span of schooling spreads over a period of 13 years starting at the age of .5. School education consists of following cycles.

Primary:			From Grade I to 5
Junior Secondary:	From Grade 6 to 9
Senior Secondary:	From Grade 10 to I I
Collegiate: 		From Grade 12 to 13

In Sri Lanka the compulsory schooling span is from 5 to 14 years. There is a wide spread network of Government schools in the island, so that every child has access to basic education. In urban areas there are a considerable number of Private and International schools. The government schools are classified according to their year span and streams available for collegiate level.


The classification of schools is as follows

Type of school					Year span

1 AB				1 to 13 or 6 to 13 with science Advance level
1C				1 to 13 or 6 to 13 without science Advanced level
2				6 to 11 or 1 to 11
3				1 to 5 or 1 to 9

Table 2:1

Number to schools is available by year span

Type of school			No				%

1AB				578				5.7
1C				1850				19.3

3				3951				39.2

Total				10088				100

At the end of grade 11 students are expected to sit a national level examination called General Certificate of Education Ordinary Level based on the curriculum studied for grades 10 and 11. The successful students are eligible for collegiate level education.



Gender & Education in Sri Lanka

The implementation of above discussed positive education policies such as free education and compulsory education without, ender differentiation has enabled females to reach high levels of educational attainment. When comparing male & female literacy rates 90.5% and 82.8% respectively at the 1981 census, it is clear that there is no significant difference between male & female literacy rates. But we can see an inequality in plantation sector and rural areas.

3.1 Provision of Education

As shown in table 2.1 the number of government schools in the island is 10088. But the distribution of schools is not equal. Although much has been achieved in providing equity and access to education disparities still exist among popular prestigious schools and less popular disadvantageous schools in the remote rural districts and urban pockets. Prestigious schools are equipped with human and physical resources such as qualified teachers, buildings, science labs and furniture. These schools have a great social demand, as the achievement levels are high. Other schools situated in remote rural and urban areas do not have sufficient infrastructure facilities. It is clear that these disparities are the result of social economic factors.


Students in rural areas have to travel long distances to gain admission to a school with all facilities. According to table 3.1 there are only 4.0 % of I AB schools in rural areas so that the rura.1 Students lack, access to science education and other education facilities such as libraries qualified teachers etc.

It is possible that the rural girls are relatively more affected by disparities in provision of facilities. In rural remote areas public transportation is in poor condition. Girls are not able to travel long distances, as it is insecure.

3.2 Participants in education

According to statistics of Ministry of Education 94% of 5 year old children entered the Education system 1999 (The survival rate in grade 5 M 1999 were 96.2% for girls and 96.7 for boys) The percentage of girls, 1n. The total enrolment in the school system has been 49.8% in 1993, 49.9% in 1997 and 50.1. In 1998, When considering province vice percentages the lowest percentage is detected in the Eastern province while Sabaragamuwa has the highest.



The overall student enrolment shows a decrease due to the decline of birth rate.

There is a trend in gender equality in age specific participation rate in Sri Lanka. In 1994, age specific participation rate of the 5-14 age group was 89.5% for girls and 89.4% for boys

Table 3.3 participation rates by Age & Gender in 1994

Age group		Total		Male		Female

5-9			83.9		84.0		83.9
10-14			94.4		94. 3		94.4
 5-14			89.5		89.4		89.5
15-19			54.5		53.4		55.3
20-24			4.7		4.7		4.6
05-24			61.8		62.2		61.4

According to the statistics of Ministry of Education 94% of 5 year olds entered the
School system in 1999, and that of 1995, survival rates in 1999 were 96.2% for girls and 96.7% for boys. This reflects continuity of gender equality in access to basic education in Sri Lanka.

In 1994 in the age group of 15 to 19, the age specific participation rate is only 55.3% for girls and 53.4% for boys. This confirms that less than 25% of entrants to the school system reached grade 12. (Table 3.3)
More boys than girls 'drop out' from schools, as boys have more opportunities in the job market. The child activity survey (1999) reveals that 25% of boys and 16.6% of girls in the age group of 15 to 17 were involved in economic activities.



This reveals that the percentage of enrolment to grades 12 and 13 is higher for girls but when it comes to the 12 and 13 Science stream it is higher for boys. However enrolments at primary and secondary levels are equal to both gender but the tendency towards the collegiate level is more for girls.

3.3 Main challenges and obstacles confronted in achieving gender equality;

Though there is gender equality in the provision of access and participation in basic education in Sri Lanka there are some issues that needs clarification. Due to lack of availability of statistics and information, the gender inequalities in school enrolments and selection of subjects at collegiate level are not detected.

3.3.1

The school mapping in Sri Lanka has affected the access to education for both gender while it is more prominent in the case of females.

As stated earlier the schools with more facilities are situated in urban areas and the possibility of rural children entering these schools Lire very limited due to lack of transportation facilities and economic problems. In brief it is a result of socio economic differences. Girls in rural areas terminate their education at primary or secondary levels, as they are not allowed to travel long distances, as the parents are more concerned about their safety. Similar socio-cultural background occurs in plantation areas especially in the families of south Indian origin and Muslim families, Apart from the socio-cultural factors socio-economic factors like poverty too affects the access to basic education. This is common in war affected areas too where more families are displaced and their only concern is food and safety.

Socialization process within family and school promotes gender role stereotypes that assist perpetual gender inequality in basic education. The society expects girls to play the role of wife, mother and housewife, that the girls are forced to select more "feminine" subjects in the school curriculum such as Home economics, Music and Biosciences while boys select subjects like Wood-work Metal-work and Agriculture. The hidden curriculum of the school too assists perpetual gender inequality in society. A teacher too plays a major role in promoting stereotype behaviour in children. Gendered socialization is an outcome of the orientation of the aspirations of goals to conventional courses in further education. It is reflected by high percentages of girls enrolled in courses like Arts, Biological sciences, Medicine Lind Education while persistent low participation in courses like Physical sciences, Engineering and Technology could also be detected for very long years. (Jayaweera, 1998)

4. National policy and programmes on woman and girls education.

4.1 Provision of free education from grade one to University had been accepted as national policy I'M- the last five decades. The const.1tution, in its chapter on the directive principles on state Policy states as one of its objectives, "The complete eradication of illiteracy and assurance to all persons the right to universal and equal access to education at all levels."

4.2 Sri Lanka ratified the charter on the rights of the child (1990) that recognizes the right to education is a basic education right in 1991.

4.3 Sri Lanka accepted the world declaration on "Education for all" adopted at Jomtien in 1990. Literacy centres for non-school going children between the ages of 6 to 14 were introduced 1n. Sri Lanka, in 1981 with the Support of the UNICEF. Out of the children enrolled in these centres 52 to 55% were girls. These centres come under the non-formal unit of the MEHE and has been improved and expanded to cover all area where non-school going children are concentrated so as to provide them an alternative opportunity to acquire literacy.

4.4 In 1997 The Parliament enacted the compulsory education regulations for 5 to 14 age group, which compelled parents to send children to school. Moreover regulations have been provided by the state for displaced families to allow admission of children to schools without submitting birth certificates.

4.5 The educational reforms proposed by the National education commission in the mid 1990s and implemented from 1998 encompass:

a. The enforcement of compulsory education regulations for 5 to 14 age group from 1998

b. Development of schools to ensure more equality in distribution of education facilities.

c. Curriculum and management reforms in schools, teacher education institutions and universities to improve the quality of education and moreover to promote the relevance of education, with regard to social and economic individual and national needs.

Furthermore, according to compulsory education regulations 8,400 school attendance committees were formed at village level and monitoring committees at zone level.

Awareness programmes for parents and general public were conducted with the assistance of international organizations.

A pilot project has been formulated for the establishment of Activity Schools with a more child friendly atmosphere, to meet the requirements of non-school going children

Another pilot project has been implemented by GTZ in Vavunia, to provide basic education for the children in war-affected areas ill t1le Northeast province.

The education reforms envisaged at least developing one Comprehensive school in each education division, which has all streams at GCE Advanced Level so as to provide equal opportunity to rural children.

International programmes supported by donor Agencies, since the nationalization of plantations in 1970 have extended educational opportunities provided for disadvantageous plantation children, which has helped achieve near gender equality in access to education. Overall percentage of total enrolment in the plantation sector increased from 45% in the 1980s while in 1996 it was 47.4%. Furthermore, in 1998 the percentage of girls in primary enrolments increased to 49%. (Jayaweera, 1998. a publication of the plantation unit of MEHE)

The New Educational reforms have introduced a new subject called Practical & Technical Skills ill the Curricula of grades 6 to 9 as a core subject which provides opportunities for children to develop their potential skills and abilities and has succeeded in eliminating gender biasness especially in the selection of technical subjects.

Conclusion

The level of education and literacy of girls and women in Sri Lanka is a positive factor.
It is more determined by socio-economic factors. National policies and programmes on education have been implemented to achieve the goals of Education For All, which are free from gender issues, as there are no significant disparities of gender in the basic education in Sri Lanka.

4.6 Technical assistance and external intervention needed:

It is a fact that 14% of' the children in the compulsory school-going age are not attending school. With the assistance of foreign donor agencies the MEHE has implemented several programmes for the out of school children that include street children and displaced children.

Literacy centres ire established for those below 14 years of age so as to provide more opportunities for fundamental education.

Activity schools are established for those children between 11 to 16 years of age that provides literacy classes as well as vocational training to help them discover their potential abilities and skills and provide necessary help to develop them.

The non-formal education unit of the MEME has also implemented adult skill development programmes to initiate the unemployed to indulge themselves in some worthwhile self-employment.

Nevertheless further assistance and external intervention is needed to strengthen these programmes. Continuous financial support is necessary for the maintenance of these centres as they are considered a social welfare without gender biasness.
